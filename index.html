<p> Epidemiology is studying and analysing the distribution of diseases in regions around the world.
The job of an epidemiologist is to examine where outbreaks of diseases happen.
Epedimiologists also analyze how the disease is spread/transmitted and effective ways to treat the disease. 
Epidimiologists have a really important job because they are the people that can find the cause of a disease, possible preventions and causes of a particular disease  </p>
